      <h3>Let's talk about <em>Informer</em></h3>
      <h4>How did this song change my life?</h4>
      <p>"Informer" by Snow was the song that gave me life... literally!  I was not even born yet, and suddenly, in March of 1993, this song bypassed "A Whole New World" from Disney's <em>Aladdin</em> and Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100. Freaking Whitney Houston and Disney!  Is this a coincidence?  I think not!</p>

      <p>So if Informer rose to the top of the charts only a few short weeks before my birth, this must be a sign, right?  There is no way I just happen to be born at the right time.  Wow!  I never knew how important one song could truly be to me. </p>
   <p>
      Anyway, I hope you enjoy my tribute website to Snow and his greatest contribution to music in the 90â€™s, "Informer."</p>

      <p>Disclaimer: I feel like it needs to be said that I am <span class="underline">not</span> the world's biggest Snow fan.  This website was created as a project for ATK 303 at Illinois State University.  A lot of my opinions on this site are heavily sarcastic and in no way reflect my true feelings for Snow or his music.</p>
