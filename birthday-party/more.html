      Do you like music from the 90’s?  What about reggae?  Do you enjoy singing along to a song but have no idea what is actually being said?  The oh, do I have a song for you!</p>

      At the top of the charts March 13-April 30, 1993 was a little ditty called "Informer" by Snow.  Who knew that a Canadian’s debut hip-hop/reggae album would have produced such a chart-topper?  MC Shan, that’s who.  He believed in this song so much that, not only did he produce the song himself, he also rapped a verse or two. </p>

      The people in the Europe didn’t believe in this song enough, however.  Sadly, it peeked at number two in the UK’s top singles.  The completely unreliable opinions of Pitchfork even rated this in the top seven worst singles of the 90s.  So really, who can you even trust?  Despite such a mixed reaction, I think we can all agree that “Informer” slaps!</p>
